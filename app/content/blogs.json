    "description": "When large language models like ChatGPT first became widely available, a lot of us developers felt like we’d been handed a new superpower.

LLMs were like a tireless, super knowledgeable pair programmer that could conjure code out of thin air. We would type a quick, messy request, and out would pop something that...kind of worked. It was amazing, but also a little frustrating. The code might be buggy, inefficient, or completely miss the subtle context of our project.",
